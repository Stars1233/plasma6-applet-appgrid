/**
 * @brief Proxy that filters KRunner results already present in AppFilterModel.
 *
 * Hides runner rows whose display name matches a visible app name (case
 * insensitive) so the unified search view doesn't show a row twice. The
 * app-name cache is rebuilt lazily: app-model changes only mark it dirty, and
 * the O(app-count) rebuild happens at most once, on the next filter pass that
 * actually needs it (skipped entirely when there are no runner rows).
