 * Thin Plasma::Applet that owns an AppGridController and exposes it (the
 * `controller` property). Both plasmoid variants drive GridPanel through that
 * controller — the same object the standalone `appgrid` executable injects — so
 * there is one implementation of the launcher surface, no per-variant forwarding.
 *
 * The applet adds only the pieces that genuinely need a live applet + corona:
 * the "Open in Compact Mode" global shortcut, the activation-inversion that
 * suppresses the native popup in custom-window mode, the in-process Task Manager
 * pin (it marks the controller and runs the pin from QML), the containment's
 * screen for "open on the panel's screen", the panel-button appearance helper,
 * and the one-shot config / launch-state migrations.
